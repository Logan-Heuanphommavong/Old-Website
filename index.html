    Hobbies

<p>
In my freetime, I work a lot. After work I usually go lift with some of my friends at Three Rivers Fitness in Otsego. I also enjoy just driving around with friends. Occasionally, I also play video games even though I'm terrible at every game.

    Gym

    I've been lifting at the gym for over two years now. I started going with one of my friends before school fo about three months. I then started going alone for a while until some other friends wanted to start lifting with me. Eventully, I had to leave the school gym because I worked so much.
