<h2>
    Hobbies
</h2>

<p>
In my freetime, I work a lot. After work I usually go lift with some of my friends at Three Rivers Fitness in Otsego. I also enjoy just driving around with friends. Occasionally, I also play video games even though I'm terrible at every game.
</p>

<h3>
    Gym
</h3>

<p>
    I've been lifting at the gym for over two years now. I started going with one of my friends before school fo about three months. I then started going alone for a while until some other friends wanted to start lifting with me. Eventully, I had to leave the school gym because I worked so much.

<h4>
    Cars
</h4>

<p>
    I always had interest in cars growing up. Although, I didn't care for them that much after getting my license, I started to become more interested because of my friends. I saw somebody's G35 and started to become intersested in those types of cars. Eventully, summer came and I bought an AWD G37 sedan.

<h5>
    Fast Food
</h5>

<p>
    Although it isn't good for you. I eat fast food more than I should. I enjoy most fast food places witht e exception of McDonald's and Taco Johns but both have at least something I enjoy. My favorite fast food places are Arby's, Five Guy's, and Cane's.
